##2015-06-xx - Release 2.0.0
###Summary

This release introduces the ability to compile and diff multiple nodes with one invocation of the preview command. The command can now also aggregate and correlate issues/diffs across multiple nodes using a new `--view overview` option.

The `--last` option can now reload information from one or multiple nodes. This enables producing different views/reports of different nodes/sets of nodes once compiled.

A `--clean` option adds the ability to clean up output generated by preview for a given set of nodes, or for all.

The `--migrate` option now takes an argument (in this released always `3.8/4.0`). The argument works in conjunction with the version of puppet in use. Puppet versions >= 3.8.0 < 4.0.0 supports the 3.8/4.0 migration checking option. Later versions of puppet/catalog preview may add support for other migration checks.

This release also updates the module's README to improve usability.
