##2015-08-04 - Release 2.0.2
###Summary

This release includes several bug fixes.

Previously when running with the Puppet 4x parser, --view diff_nodes would produce an incorrect list of nodes both with --last and without. That bug has been fixed and now the correct list of nodes will be printed.

With previous versions of PuppetDB, catalog_preview used its own variant of the fact terminus. With the release of PuppetDB 3, catalog_preview needs to use PuppetDB's fact terminus instead which meant it was broken with PuppetDB 3. That bug has been fixed and catalog_preview will now adjust accordingly based on the version of PuppetDB being used.

Previously, catalog_preview diffs were not displaying tag parameters in a human readable format. It would just display a Ruby object reference. Now that bug has been fixed and the tags are displayed properly.

##2015-07-14 - Release 2.0.1
###Summary

This release includes a minor bug fix and additional version checking.

An exclude entry that has a null `attributes` property will completely exclude the resources that it will match. When this happens, it is important to also exclude all edges where the resource is either the source or the target. This release has been fixed to ensure that happens.

Due to a bug in PE 3.8.0 which prevents you from setting your parser per environment, the documented migration work flow does not work with PE 3.8.0. This release adds some additional version checking so that the user will be warned when they are trying to migrate with PE 3.8.0.

##2015-06-30 - Release 2.0.0
###Summary

This release introduces the ability to compile and diff multiple nodes with one invocation of the preview command. The command can now also aggregate and correlate issues/diffs across multiple nodes using a new `--view overview` option.

The `--last` option can now reload information from one or multiple nodes. This enables producing different views/reports of different nodes/sets of nodes once compiled.

A `--clean` option adds the ability to clean up output generated by preview for a given set of nodes, or for all.

The `--migrate` option now takes an argument (in this released always `3.8/4.0`). The argument works in conjunction with the version of puppet in use. Puppet versions >= 3.8.0 < 4.0.0 supports the 3.8/4.0 migration checking option. Later versions of puppet/catalog preview may add support for other migration checks.

Short form options for `--preview_environment` (`--pe`) and `--baseline_environment` (`--be`) have been added.

An `--excludes exclusion_file` option has ben added that allows resources to be excluded from
the catalog diff processing. It is possible to exclude all resource of a type, all attributes
of a given resource title, or specific attributes of a type, or for a title. This can be used
for resources that have values that are known to always differ between compilations e.g because attributes are set to random values, a value based on date/time, etc.

The `--help` command includes a description of the migration warnings that are produced in the
preview_log and explains how to deal with such warnings.

This release also updates the module's README to improve usability by including a small dictionary of terms and explanations for the migration specific warnings produced by the `migrate 3.8/4.0` option.
